# Chatbase Integration Guide

## Steps to Integrate Chatbase Chatbot

### 1. Get Your Chatbase Embed Code

1. Go to [Chatbase.co](https://www.chatbase.co) and sign in
2. Create or select your chatbot
3. Go to the "Embed" or "Settings" section
4. Copy your chatbot ID or embed code

### 2. Integration Options

Chatbase typically provides one of these integration methods:

#### Option A: Script Tag (Recommended)
- Chatbase will give you a script tag with your chatbot ID
- Example: `<script src="https://www.chatbase.co/embed.js" chatbotId="YOUR_CHATBOT_ID" domain="YOUR_DOMAIN"></script>`

#### Option B: React Component
- Some Chatbase plans offer a React component/widget
- You'll get an npm package or component code

#### Option C: Iframe Embed
- Direct iframe embed code
- Less customizable but simple

### 3. Next Steps

Once you have your Chatbase embed code, I can help you:
- Replace the current SerenaGPT page with the Chatbase widget
- Add the script to the layout or page
- Style it to match your design

**Please provide:**
